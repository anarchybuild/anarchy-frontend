              <strong>Ownership & License:</strong> You retain ownership of your User Content. However, by uploading User Content to the Platform, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, and display your User Content in connection with the operation of the Platform.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Third-Party AI Tools:</strong> The Platform provides access to various third-party AI tools via API. By using these tools through the Platform, you agree to be bound by the respective terms of service, intellectual property policies, and privacy policies of those third-party AI tool providers. Anarchy is not the author or owner of the underlying AI models.

                Content generated through AI tools integrated within Anarchy may not be protected under copyright law, particularly in the absence of substantial human creative input. As a result, any license or assignment you grant over such content may not confer legal exclusivity against third parties. Anarchy provides traceability and technical certification mechanisms to support commercial use, but does not guarantee registrability or legal protection of such content outside the Platform. For stronger legal standing, we recommend editing, complementing, or significantly modifying the content prior to external use.

                The User acknowledges and agrees that content generated through artificial intelligence tools integrated into the Platform may not be protected as original works under current intellectual property legislation, due to the possible absence of significant human authorship. Nevertheless, the User shall hold contractual rights of use, control, and commercial exploitation over such content within the Anarchy ecosystem and may grant licenses or assignments to third parties to the extent permitted by applicable law. In all cases, the User agrees not to use or authorize the use of such content in a manner that would conflict with rights contractually granted to third parties. Any license or assignment made by the User over such content shall be deemed made under a "quitclaim" or "imperfect title" structure, valid to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Anarchy assumes no liability regarding the legal protection or registrability of User-generated content outside its Platform.
