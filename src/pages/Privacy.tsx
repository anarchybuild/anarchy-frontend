          Some of the processing described in the above table will include the processing of 'special categories of personal data', criminal offences data and/or sensitive personal data (together, "Sensitive Information" – as set out in the table at paragraph 3, above). This refers to sensitive, criminal offences or special categories of personal data which we are required to process with more care, according to applicable laws.

          We may transfer your personal data to external recipients that are established in jurisdictions other than your own.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Please be aware that the data protection laws in some jurisdictions may not provide the same level of protection to your personal data as is provided to it under the laws in your jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We will always seek to ensure that adequate protections are put in place when transferring your personal data from within to outside the UK or European Economic Area. For more information regarding the transfers undertaken by us and the protections put in place, please contact us using the details set out at the end of this Notice.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How do we keep your personal data secure?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We will take specific steps (as required by applicable data protection laws) to ensure we take appropriate security measures to protect your personal data from unlawful or unauthorised processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How long do we keep your personal data for?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We will only retain your personal data for a limited period of time (for example, for so long as you use our Services (up to 24 months) plus a period of time following, based on the factors below), and for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which we are processing your personal data. This will depend on a number of factors, including:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>any laws or regulations that we are required to follow;</li>
          <li>whether we are in a legal or other type of dispute with each other or any third party;</li>
          <li>the type of information that we hold about you; and</li>
          <li>whether we are asked by you or a regulatory authority to keep your personal data for a valid reason.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How do we communicate with you?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">We will use your personal data to communicate with you:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>to administer our relationship with you;</li>
          <li>to respond to any questions or complaints that you may have; and</li>
          <li>to invite you to take part in market research or request feedback on our products and services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          From time to time and with your consent (where required), we will provide you with information about token sales, services, promotions and/or offers which may be of interest to you.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Where you have subscribed to our online newsletter, we will also provide a copy by email.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What are your privacy rights and how can you exercise them?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Where our processing of your personal data is based on your consent (please see the tables above), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you do decide to withdraw your consent we will stop processing your personal data for that purpose, unless there is another lawful basis we can rely on – in which case, we will let you know.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Where our processing of your personal data is based on the legitimate interests (please see the tables above), you can object to this processing at any time. If you do this, we will need to show either a compelling reason why our processing should continue, which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms or that the processing is necessary for us to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to that processing at any time. You can do this by unsubscribing to the address specified in a direct marketing email or by notifying us at info@archisinal.io.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Laws in certain jurisdictions may provide individuals with rights relating to personal data, such as those listed below. We will honour these rights to the extent required by law. You have the right to (subject to applicable laws and certain limitations):
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>access your personal data and to be provided with certain information in relation to it, such as the purpose for which it is processed, the persons to whom it is disclosed and the period for which it will be stored;</li>
          <li>require us to correct any inaccuracies in your personal data without undue delay;</li>
          <li>require us to erase your personal data;</li>
          <li>require us to restrict processing of your personal data;</li>
          <li>receive the personal data which you have provided to us, in a machine-readable format, where we are processing it on the basis of your consent or because it is necessary for your contract with us (please see the tables above) and where the processing is automated; and</li>
          <li>object to a decision that we make which is based solely on automated processing of your personal data (however, we do not currently conduct any such decision making).</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you wish to exercise any of these rights please contact info@archisinal.io in the first instance. We will aim to respond to all legitimate requests within one month of receipt.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection regulator (for example for the Information Commissioner's Office in the UK).
